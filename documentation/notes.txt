FOUNDATION CSS
==============
    -We are using a custom build of foundation 6.5. it has all of the components from version 6.5, but instead of the grid using 12 columns, it has 24 instead, for more flexibility.

        - When updating foundation, make sure to use the "customize foundation" and set the grid to 24 columns.
