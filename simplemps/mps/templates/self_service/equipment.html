                        1. Decide on the type of equipment. You may add printers/copiers that you already own (include
                        existing) or select new equipment that will be purchased as part of the proposal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Use the filters to narrow your options. Existing equipment can only be filtered by Brand and
                        Mono/Color while new equipment includes many more options to help you decide what best meets
                        your
                        needs. When you check off an option, this area of the screen will be replaced with a list of
                        equipment that meets the criteria.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. When you see a model which you would like to add to the proposal, click Select and you will
                        be
                        able to fill in some important information about the device. Lastly click Add when you are
                        finished
                        inputting data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4. You may switch between types of equipment as much as you like, we will keep track of
                        everything
                        for you! When you switch equipment types, the filters will be cleared and these instructions
                        will be
                        displayed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once you have finished selecting one type of equipment, click the Review Selection tab or change
                        the
                        Equipment Type to add a different type. Good luck!

                        <br>
                        - As a rule, less expensive equipment costs more per page to print (supplies tend to be more
                        expensive) and they donâ€™t hold up as well under heavy print volumes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Color printing is much more expensive than monochrome. Some of the new color printers have a
                        greatly reduced printing cost. If you have an older color device, replacing it with a new color
                        (or
                        monochrome) printer may provide a quick ROI.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - If you need to print 11x17 documents, there are fewer equipment choices and they tend to be
                        higher
                        priced.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Consider taking this opportunity to replace some of your older devices with newer more
                        reliable
                        printers. While you may have elected to include service with your proposal, down time is still
                        expensive.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - New print technology tends to be much faster than on older devices.
