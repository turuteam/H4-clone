  </div>
  <p>
    <b> 1. The Agreement:</b> This part of the document sets out the full terms and conditions of the agreement (“the Agreement”) made between U.S. Business Systems, Inc. (“USBS”) as described herein and the customer (“the Customer”) described herein for the purchase of the equipment and/or service and consumables described herein as (“the Equipment”) and (“Services & Supplies Agreement”). The Agreement commences following acceptance by USBS on the date of signing the Agreement by a Director of USBS and these terms and conditions may only be varied by written agreement between the Customer and the Managing Director of USBS.
    <b> All sales are final and are non-cancellable. </b><br>
    The Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Michigan. <br>
    At the date on which the Customer signs the Agreement, the Customer shall be deemed to be satisfied that the Equipment is reasonably fit for the purposes for which it is to be used by the Customer.
    <b>2. Installation:</b> The Customer shall ensure the premises in which the Equipment is to be installed are ready to receive the Equipment and shall make available to USBS free of charge all such light, heat, air, electric power, communications ports, and other facilities as may be reasonably required for the installation and preparation of the Equipment.  <br>
    The Equipment shall be at risk of the Customer (a) At and from the time when the Equipment is delivered by USBS to the Customer at the installation address specified opposite or (b) At the time the Equipment is collected from USBS’ premises and is being loaded by the Customer for collection or from the time USBS notifies the Customer that the Equipment is ready for dispatch whichever is earlier. <br>
    Unless the Agreement specifically provides for installation by USBS the Customer shall arrange for collection of the Equipment from USBS’ premises. If the Customer fails to collect Equipment within seven days after notification the Equipment is ready for dispatch, the Customer shall pay USBS a fee per week equivalent to five percent of the purchase price of the Equipment, such fee to be paid monthly in arrears.  <br>
    <b>Network connected devices include our standard installation which includes the following and will not exceed one (1) hour per connected device;   1).  System software and drivers installed onto one (1) server and up to two (2) workstations.   2).  Training on the software and driver functionality supplied by USBS.  </b><br>
    <b>Additional time required for driver installation onto more than two (2) workstations or for more in depth training on the equipment will be billed at the then prevailing rate for IT services, unless The Equipment is covered under The Connection Protection Advantage Agreement. </b><br>
    <b>3. Compensation:</b>Unless otherwise agreed in writing by USBS payment for the Equipment shall be made in full by the Customer to USBS without any deductions or withholding on any account whatsoever within thirty days following the date of invoice. If any sum due to USBS under the terms of the Agreement is not paid at the due date, the Customer will from time to time pay USBS on demand interest on the unpaid balance for the period beginning on the due date for payment of the same and ending on the date of actual payment at the rate of five percent above the prime rate of Bank of America for the time being and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by USBS as a result of pursuit of collection due to Customer’s nonpayment. <br>
    The Customer shall be responsible for any applicable tax charges for any amount due for goods or services provided by USBS under this Agreement. The prices stated opposite do not include tax unless specified in writing to include tax.  <br>
    The Customer agrees to compensate USBS for maintenance and services based on the Customer’s monthly copy volume and the listing of Attachments for Connection Protection. Payment shall be made quarterly in advance at the agreed upon rates as set forth herein or at time to time applicable. Per copy cost is based on 8 1/2 x 11 paper. Sizes larger than 8 1/2 x 11 shall be treated as two copies. Connection Protection cost is based on the Attachments listed as covered. Attachments that are not listed as covered will be charged at the then prevailing rate for the required services. <br>
    The agreed upon monthly copy volume and per Attachment rate is the minimum amount that shall be charged to the Customer. Any excess usage of that minimum figure shall be payable by the Customer at a rate equal to the agreed copy cost per quarter in arrears. Any additional charges of the minimum figures as a result of reasons described in the <b> Maintenance and Service </b>  clause shall be payable by the Customer at the then prevailing hourly rate and subject to normal payment terms as described within this document.   <br>
    USBS reserves the right to increase the per copy cost and the per attachment cost at any time once annually. USBS shall provide thirty days notice to the Customer prior to the effective date of the increase. The increase amount will be dictated by the plan option chosen by the Customer at the time of this Agreement execution. In the event that the increase exceeds the amount described within the chosen plan’s description, the Customer shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement provided that the Customer gives ninety days written notice within thirty days of receiving the proposed increase, unless the increase is justified by an equivalent increase in USBS’ operating costs. <br>
    The Customer shall pay USBS for all charges due under this Agreement within thirty days of the date of the invoice. Failure to pay by the Customer results in a continuous breach and relieves USBS of its obligations under this Agreement until the Customer pays the invoice. In the event USBS should have to pursue collection action against the Customer, the Customer shall be responsible for interest calculated at five percent above the prime rate at the time of the breach and reasonable attorney fees incurred by USBS as a result of the Customer’s non-payment. <br> The Customer shall be responsible for any applicable tax charges for any amount due for goods or services provided by USBS under this Agreement.
