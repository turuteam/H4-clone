            <p>1. You and the Company agree that:</p>
            <p><b>(1) Services</b></p>
            <p>a) Service under this Agreement, (the “Service”), includes replacement of all standard parts to maintain the equipment listed by

            <p>business hours will be on an “as available” basis and will be billed at the then current hourly rates for overtime labour.</p>
            <p>d) It is understood that the Customer Equipment covered by this SOW is in good condition on the date this SOW becomes effective.
                Should the Service Provider consider that an overhaul of Customer Equipment is necessary before accepting this SOW, a cost
                estimate of labour and material charges will be submitted for CDW’s authorization before proceeding with the work. Such charges
                will be in addition to the rate set forth above.</p>
            <p>e) If this SOW includes toner, Customer may use the toner only in Equipment covered by the SOW. Customer shall notify the Service
                Provider of any equipment subsequently acquired by Customer which uses toner cartridges of the same type as those supplied by
                the Service Provider for the Equipment, and CDW will include the newly acquired Equipment under the SOW. The addition of
                equipment to this SOW may require an adjustment to the rate per page.</p>
            <p>f) Used parts and toner cartridge cores, spent or otherwise, supplied by the Service Provider for Customer’s use remain the property
                of the Service Provider and must be returned to a representative of the Service Provider. A charge of $20.00 per cartridge will be
                payable if spent toner cartridges are not returned.</p>
            <p>g) This SOW does not include the rebuilding, reconditioning of, re-installation of or alterations to the Equipment.</p>
            <p>h) Service on Equipment that is more than seven (7) years old will be provided a best efforts basis and may be withdrawn within 90
                days’ notice if the Service Provider in its sole discretion believes that acceptable performance standards cannot be maintained.</p>
            <p>i) All components of any one integral system must be simultaneously covered by a Service Agreement.</p>
            <p>(2) <b>Commencement:</b> This SOW’s original term (the “Term”) commences on the date (“Commencement Date”) that CDW accepts
                this SOW and shall remain in effect for the number of calendar months indicated as the “Term” unless terminated by either party
                for the other party’s default. Unless this SOW is cancelled by CDW or the Service Provider by written notice at least thirty (30) days
                prior to the completion of the Term, it will be automatically renewed at expiry for a subsequent twelve (12) months until cancelled,
                without submission of another executed agreement, in accordance with the terms above.</p>
            <p>(3) <b>Payments:</b> Under this SOW the payments CDW will be required to make are periodic payments based on the schedule included
                in this SOW.</p>
            <P>If impressions are included in the Total Payment, plus applicable Taxes, are payable to the Service Provider regardless of usage at,
                until notice from the Service Provider, the address indicated above. Impressions will be calculated starting the 1st of each month
                until the last day of each month. All devices under this SOW will be billed a minimum 250 pages per month. Should Customer exceed
                the included number of impressions during any period of this SOW an Overage charge per impression will be charged based on the
                SOW’s schedule. CDW shall, within 30 days of the Service Provider’s request therefor, pay the Company an amount (an “Overage
                Payment”) plus applicable taxes.</P>
            <p>CDW agrees that the Service Provider, on each anniversary of the Commencement Date, will increase the Charge(s) per Page and
                Overage Charge(s) per Page, to cover its increased costs up to maximum of 10%. The Rate per Page is also subject to increase if
                average toner coverage per page is consistently greater than 5% (monochrome) or 20% (colour).</p>
            <p>The Company shall be entitled to obtain impressions counts at the end of each Payment Period. CDW will provide the Service
                Provider with any reasonable assistance necessary to permit the Service Provider to obtain accurate impression counts, including
                facilitating the installation of software and/or hardware to enable electronic meter readings. If electronic meter readings cannot be
                obtained, Customer representative will provide meter readings to the Service Provider at the end of each billing period. If the Service
                Provider is unable to ascertain the actual number of impressions Customer have made during the period, the Service Provider shall
                estimate Customer’s impression usage. CDW shall make an Overage Payment based upon such estimate and future payments shall
                be adjusted to reflect any difference between actual and estimated usage.</p>
            <p>(4) <b>Print Quality:</b> Before acceptance of the SOW, the Service Provider may make a sample print on Equipment and obtain a signature
                from Customer representative attesting to the acceptability of the print quality. Prints which do not meet this standard because of</p>
